# Personal Reflection

**Which role did you choose and why?**
I chose the **Backend Engineer** role because I already have experience with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**. I enjoy working with data logic and server-side architecture more than visual interfaces.

**What is one thing about the product’s architecture that was new to you?**
The concept of "Diagrams as Code" (using Mermaid) was new to me. I realized how useful it is to keep diagrams versioned together with the code instead of using static images.

**Which course topics seem most relevant to your chosen role?**
**Docker** and **CI/CD** seem the most relevant. I know how to write code, but deploying it automatically and consistently is a skill I am missing.

**What is one concrete skill you would like to improve this semester?**
I want to master **Automated Testing (Pytest)**. I want to be able to write tests that ensure my API works correctly before I even push the code.
